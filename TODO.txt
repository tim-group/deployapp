Fix on ruby 1.9.3

-> test for symlink
-> put full mc tests into build

-> change package names
    -> split up:
        -> deploytool.deb
        -> orc.deb

-> delete one shot stuff for now..

-> no classes in root..

PUPPET:
    -> rename deploytool - javahttpservice
    -> setup services to auto start??

DONE..
[]-> move stuff only used in tests to test folder
[]    ->  MemoryPart
[]-> EmbeddedJavaCom

REFACTOR:

Scenarios:
    NO PID FILE - STOP DOESN'T WORK...??


TODO:
